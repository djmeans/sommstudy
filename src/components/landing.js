                <p>Hello and thank you for taking the time to use my app. Hopefully this can be of use to you on your journey to become a Sommolier. As of now, the varietal data is a bit non-descript and in future implementations (and with your help) I would like to give each region its own varietal description so that the information can be inclusive of terrior and much more localized/specific. Take a look around and feel free to shoot me an email with any feedback! 
                </p>
