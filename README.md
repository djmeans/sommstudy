This application is a study-guide for people getting ready for their level two Sommelier test. There are 49 places in the world of which the Guild of Master Sommeliers deems the growth of certain varietals important enough to memorize and know. I created a dynamic map rendering to show the latitude/longitude of these places with pins to show where each of these locations is. In the future, with users inputting data, the app will showcase the differences in each varietal based on the location in which the grape is grown.
